# Opening the Black Box of Deep Neural Networks with more information

A lot of methods and approaches exist for effective training and application of neural networks, however they are still not well understood theoretically. In this project we explore the evolution of various neural networks trained with stochastic gradient descent using information plane approach proposed by Schwartz-Ziv and Tishby, replicate their experiments as well as introduce our own modifications.
